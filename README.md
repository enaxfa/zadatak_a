# Python REST API Microservice with CRUD Operations

This project deploys a REST API using Python, suitable for a microservice architecture. It includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and is fully containerized using Docker. The API communicates with a database instance, also running in Docker, to persist data.

## Key Features
- **Microservice Architecture**: REST API built with Flask
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete data.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Both the API and database are containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database integrated with Docker and linked to the API container.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Python with Flask
- **Database**:PostgreSQL running in a Docker container
- **Containerization**: Docker for deploying both the API and the database
- **Communication**: API and database communicate over a Docker network


### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
